## About Private Processing

Private Processing is a secure technology from Meta that enables certain optional Meta AI features, like summarizing messages, providing writing help, and Incognito chats with Meta AI.

Private Processing enables you to use Meta AI for processing messages off-device in a confidential and secure environment where no one, not even Meta or WhatsApp, can read or access your messages. After Private Processing finishes responding to your request or you exit an Incognito chat with Meta AI, the messages aren’t stored.

### Note:

- Meta AI and some experiences are currently only available in limited countries and might not be available to you yet, even if others in your country have access.
- At this time, only English, Indonesian, Portuguese, and Spanish are supported.

## How it works

Meta's Private Processing is built on top of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). It allows you to direct AI to process your requests in a secure and private cloud environment where no one, including Meta and WhatsApp, can access your messages.

Requests to Private Processing only include data that’s useful for processing the user’s request. Your request and messages are sent encrypted between your device and Private Processing, and Meta and WhatsApp can’t read them. Private Processing doesn’t retain access to or store the messages or response after your request is completed. You can learn more in our [white paper](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/private-processing-technical-whitepaper).

We provide transparency when AI experiences use Private Processing. If you don’t want to use certain Meta AI features that use Private Processing, such as writing help or message summaries, you can opt-out of those specific features in **Settings**. Chatting with Meta AI in an Incognito chat is always optional.
